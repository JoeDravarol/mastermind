# Mastermind Game (Command line version)

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. The idea of the game is for one player (the code-breaker) to guess the secret code chosen by the other player (the code-maker). The code is 4 digits long from the number 1 to 6. The code-maker can repeat the same number any number of times for example: "1124" or "1111".

This is the second project where I will be using the OOP concept I have learnt so far to recreate the Mastermind game in command line. I will be adding a computer/AI for the player to play against.
